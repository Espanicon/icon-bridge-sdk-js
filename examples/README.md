In this folder you can find a set of example code files showing how to use the `IconBridgeSDK` in different scenarios (i.e for a Node.js application or in a React web app, etc). Most of the example files need for you to add a valid public and/or private key for the ICON or the BSC chains (depending on the example file.).
